JS - was meant to run only in the browser
Following are some JS engines that are present in modern day browser to run
JavaScript:
Google Chrome - V8 Engine.
Mozilla Firefox - SpiderMonkey.
Node was developed by Ryan Dahl to run JS outside of the browser.
Node = V8 Engine/SpiderMonkey + Inbuilt Node Modules
Node is a Runtime environment, that allows JS to run outside of browsers in
local machines as well.
Now lets see some quick examples to understand this concept
of runtime environment:
Playstation games can run in a play station console only.
I can make tandoori roti in a tandoor only.
Notes 2
CJS
//for importing
const x = require("module")
//for exporting
module.exports = x
Common JS method is used to import or export any Node module.
We are not using ES6 method of importing and exporting because almost all the
industries in the market use the CJS method only, and we have to align with the
same as most of the resources present on web also prefers the same.

Note: Go through the Documentation of node as well, and experiment yourself,
